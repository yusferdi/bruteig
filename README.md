# Instagram BruteForce

Instagram brute force tools are PHP-coded utilities designed to automate the process of attempting various combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access to Instagram accounts. 

These tools leverage PHP's scripting capabilities to send HTTP requests to Instagram's login endpoint, systematically testing different credentials until a successful login is achieved or until a predetermined set of attempts is exhausted. 

While these tools may be developed for legitimate security testing purposes, they are often misused for unethical activities such as hacking into accounts without permission. 

```
It's important to note that using such tools to access accounts without authorization is illegal and violates Instagram's terms of service.
``` 

Additionally, engaging in unauthorized access to accounts can have serious legal consequences and may result in legal action by Instagram or law enforcement authorities. 

```
Therefore, it's crucial to use these tools responsibly and only with explicit permission from the account owner or authorized parties for legitimate security testing purposes. 
```




## Usage/Examples

Install PHP in your desk and run:

```
$ php bruteig.php
